A nifty tool to sync custom presets and settings between standalone BIAS and Garageband sandboxes. 

Note: Does not append! Your presets and settings from the BIAS/BIAS FX standalone software will replace those in the Garageband BIAS/BIAS FX plugin. Previous presets and settings from both sandboxes will be backed up in folder: Document/Presets_Backup/

Usage:
Step 1. Double-click on syncBIASwithGB.command executable file.
Step 2. Confirm sync on Terminal with 'Y' (capitalized).
